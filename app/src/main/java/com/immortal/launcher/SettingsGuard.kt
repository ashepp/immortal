/**
 * Self-healing for our screensaver settings. The stock Aloha launcher rewrites
 * `screensaver_components` / `screensaver_default_component` back to its own
 * SuperFrame whenever it runs, so Immortal re-asserts them on boot and on every
 * resume. Requires `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, which provisioning grants via
 * `pm grant` — without it this is a silent no-op (settings stay as provisioned).
 *
 * Note: the *home* role can't be reasserted this way (it isn't a secure setting
 * and needs system privilege); provisioning sets it separately via
 * `cmd package set-home-activity`. The stock launcher stays enabled and remains
 * explicitly launchable — that's what the Calls tile bridges to.
