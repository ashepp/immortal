/**
 * Minimal device-admin receiver. A normal app can't turn the Portal's screen off
 * (PowerManager.goToSleep is a signature permission), so Immortal registers as a
 * device admin with only the FORCE_LOCK policy and uses
 * DevicePolicyManager.lockNow() for its idle and overnight screen-off features.
 *
 * Provisioning activates it with `dpm set-active-admin com.immortal.launcher/.AdminReceiver`;
 * if it isn't active, [ScreenControl.sleep] is a harmless no-op.
