# Immortal install daemon. Runs as the shell user (uid 2000) — started once via
# ADB during provisioning — so it can `pm install` silently, bypassing the broken
# on-device installer dialog on the Gen-1 Portal+. The launcher drops APKs in the
# queue; this installs them and writes a heartbeat so the launcher knows it's alive.
#
# Note: like all non-root helpers (e.g. Shizuku), this does NOT survive a reboot;
# re-run `provision.sh --installd` (or the kit) to restart it.
