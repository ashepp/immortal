# Changelog

## 1.8 (2026-06-05)

Universal installer — make sideloading work on the Gen-1 Portal+, whose built-in Android installer dialog is broken (renders with no buttons).

- **"Open with Immortal"** (`ApkInstallActivity`): opening any APK — from Chrome, a file manager, or a third-party store like Aurora ("Session/Native" installer mode) — routes through Immortal's silent daemon. Shows an "Install <app>? via Immortal" card; installs with no system dialog.
- **"Install an APK"** browser (`ApkBrowserActivity`): lists APKs in Downloads and installs them on a tap, from the App Store header.
- **Shizuku** (optional): `provision.sh --shizuku` / `-Shizuku` installs Shizuku (if `SHIZUKU_APK_URL` set) and starts its server over ADB, for apps that use the Shizuku API directly. Resolves the version/ABI-specific starter at runtime. Like the daemon, restart after a reboot.
- **Paused banner** copy clarified for Gen-1 ("reinstall Immortal to restore").

## 1.0 (2026-06-05)

Initial public release of Immortal — a custom home-screen layer for discontinued Meta Portal devices.

- **Launcher**: fullscreen app grid, clock/date/weather header, optional Portal Go charge indicator.
- **Folders**: drag one app onto another to create a folder; name, rename, and drag apps back out.
- **Manage mode**: remove apps with a tap; special tiles stay put and non-uninstallable.
- **Calls bridge**: one-tap route to the stock dialer/contacts for WhatsApp and Messenger calling.
- **Screensaver**: photo frame with stock-style widgets, swipe navigation, tap to exit.
- **App Store**: hosted JSON catalog, on-device install via PackageInstaller, live F-Droid resolution.
- **Self-update**: polls a hosted manifest and installs new builds over itself — no cable.
- **Provisioning kit**: one double-click to install, set home + screensaver, and freeze OS updates. Fully reversible.
